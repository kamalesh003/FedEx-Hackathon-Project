# Dynamic-Routing-Web-App

# Real-Time Route Optimizer üåçüöó  

A Flask-based web application that enables real-time route optimization using live data from multiple APIs. The application tracks routes dynamically, calculates emissions, and provides updates on weather, air quality, and traffic conditions.  

## Features üöÄ  
- **Real-time Route Tracking:** Monitor route progress and update current location dynamically.  
- **Environmental Impact:** Calculate emissions based on vehicle type, weather, air quality, and traffic conditions.  
- **Interactive Map:** Visualize start, end, and current location along with the optimized route.  
- **Live Data Integration:**  
  - Weather updates via [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api).  
  - Air Quality Index (AQI) updates via [AQICN API](https://aqicn.org/api/).  
  - Traffic conditions via [TomTom Traffic API](https://developer.tomtom.com/traffic-api).  
  - Route optimization via [GraphHopper API](https://www.graphhopper.com/).  

## Technologies Used üõ†  
- **Backend:** Flask  
- **Frontend:** HTML, Bootstrap, Folium for interactive maps) ,CSS ,Javascript [Single Page Application Approach] 
- **Geolocation:** Geopy  
- **Threading:** For real-time location updates  

## Prerequisites üß∞  
- Python 3.7+  
- API keys for:  
  - [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api)  
  - [AQICN API](https://aqicn.org/api/)  
  - [TomTom Traffic API](https://developer.tomtom.com/traffic-api)  
  - [GraphHopper API](https://www.graphhopper.com/)
